I am interested in knots, links, and surfaces in 4-manifolds. In particular, I am interested in questions related to sliceness, minimality of knot cobordisms in general, and how they relate to knot homology theories.



### Squeezed knots and satellite operations (in preparation)
Feller, Lewark, and Lobb define a "squeezed knot" to be any knot which arises as a level set of a genus-minimizing cobordism from a positive torus knot to a negative torus knot. Given a squeezed knot, they show that all slice torus evaluations agree on it and show that many well-studied families of knots are squeezed. We expand the collection of squeezed knots by proving that any cable knot with squeezed companion is squeezed.
