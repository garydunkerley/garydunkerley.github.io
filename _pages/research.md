I am interested in knots, links, and surfaces in 4-manifolds. 
In particular, I am drawn to questions about cobordisms between knots or links subject to geometrically-motivated restrictions such as being genus-minimizing or set-wise invariant under some symmetry. I study such surfaces by looking at how certain functors (called link TQFTs) convert these surfaces into (for example) linear maps between vector spaces.
